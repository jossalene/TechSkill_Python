	<h2 id="first">Introduction</h2>
		<p id="one">Last week, students in Psychology Statistics classes took their first exam, which coverred from Chapter 1 to 4. The Exam has the total of 13 questions and students had roughly 2 hours to download, complete and submit the exam. Section AB took the exam at 8 AM while section CD took the exam at 10:30 AM. The two sections were taught the same materials and have the same grading rubric for the exam </p>

		<p id="one">The exam scores are recorded and analyzed for comparison between the two sections. You can check out the raw data <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jossalene/CodingCult/master/Exam1.csv">here</a></p>

	<h2 id="second">The basics of ggplot2 and plotly</h2>
		<p id="two">ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, the idea that you can build every graph from the same few components: a data set, a set of geoms-visual marks that represent data points, and a coordinate system. <a href="https://r-graphics.org/index.html">R Graphics Cookbook </a> is a great online book to learn more about plotting with ggplot2</p>

		<p id="two">Plotly is an open-source data visualization library for Python and R written in JavaScript, making graphs inherently interactive. Visit <a href="https://plotly-r.com/index.html"> Plotly R </a>to learn how to make beautiful plots using plotly in R</p>

	<h2 id="last">Final words</h2>
		<p id="final">It has been very fun for me to work on this small project. I am able to spend sometime to do something that I love, plus I also review some of the R graphing techniques I learned last year. I hope that you love those pretty graphs, too!  &#127804 &#127804 &#127804 &#127804 &#127804	</p>
