    "Final Grade has always been students' most concerned topic during their academic life since everyone wants to know their grade before it is posted at the end of the term. It goes the same to me as I am taking Python this summer. So I thought I should create a program to help me and my classmates calculate our grade for this specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also consider this blog as a practice project for what I have learned and read so far in our Python class this summer. I hope that you would find it useful as it is not only our grade calculator for the class but also as a general review of the first half of our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program will mainly use **`If`** condition as well as **`try`** and **`except`**. Therefore, we can expect it to be lengthy.\n",

    "What makes this project interesting is that we have both graduate and undergraduate students in my class. And they have slightly different grading system to get the accurate grade for a specific student. If we compare the grade breakdown between undergrad and grad students, we see that the grad student is having more assessment items such as one extra Blog and a Data Analysis project, thus, making their grading proportion different from the undergrad students.\n",
